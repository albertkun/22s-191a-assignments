                Hi my name is Jenny and I'm a 3rd year economics major and asian american studies minor. I'm not really sure 
                about what goals I have as a critical digital mapmaker, but I definitely want to
                learn how to better use online tools to create things. I think that mapmaking has a lot of
                potential for good and I would really like to learn how to properly make a map that
                also gives insight to certain social issues. Outside of school, I love to hang out with my friends and 
                try new foods/go to happy hours and soft openings and go shopping!
            </p>
